# RIT-Resilience-Game
This is Sector Down, a asymtrical card game meant to simulate cyber-attacks and cyber-security principles.

The current version of this game was based of off the foundation of Jessica Bayliss' game accessDenied.
Her repo can be found here: https://github.com/profjdbayliss/accessDenied


For new employees:

As of 8/22/2024 this version of the game can support two players drawing and discarding cards and playing cards that draw more cards.
There is a branch named Player-Teams-WIP which has started in implement Lists of each teams that must be shared over the network.
This branch is not complete and it may be better to start with the main branch.

After teams are implemented it is reccomended that you then implement team turns and then move on to implementing card actions.
There are several TODO comments left throughout the code if you are unsure what to do next.

If you need help with Networking or the general code reach out to Jessica
If you need clarifcation on the design of the game reach out to Dariel Ramos or James Zilberman
If there are specific code related questions reach out to James Zilberman
